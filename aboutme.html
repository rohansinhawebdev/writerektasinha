                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p class="text">
                    <br>Ekta lives in Ghaziabad along with her husband and two kids. When she is not working or writing, she loves to indulge in her hobbies which include playing chess, cards, badminton, cooking, and watching movies.
                    
                    <br>A June child, Ekta married early in life, and soon after, was involved in raising her two kids, and being a homemaker. It was in her 40s that she was bitten by the writer’s bug and from then onwards, there was no looking back. It wasn’t an easy journey in the beginning, but one that was oddly satisfying.
                    
                    <br>What came next was not one but two books back-to-back, The Blazing Moon: Journey to Hell, and The Deal in Akmud, both of which received generous reviews from readers across all platforms. Her books are currently available on Amazon, Flipkart, and Kindle platforms.
                    
                    <br>Her latest book, The Deal in Akmud is a mysterious and fantastical thriller where good gets pitted against evil.
                    
                    <br>Ekta currently writes scripts and pitches stories for ad films, short films, and web series, and sends them to production houses.
                    
                    <br>Her mantras for life – 
                    <strong>
                    "Nothing can stop you if you don’t will to give up!"" 
                    
                    <br>"Don’t expect much but don’t forget to take small steps if you want to reach somewhere."
                </strong>
